/* db1_client/jti_replay.c: the jti_replay family, reached over the bus.
 *
 * WAS GENERATED from the store catalog by scripts/gen_db1_contract.py. Both
 * moved on: the catalog is now server-go/modules/aimee/operations.json, and the
 * generator was deleted with the C module.
 *
 * So this is maintained BY HAND now, and the header used to say "Do not edit"
 * while pointing at a generator that no longer exists and a path that no longer
 * resolves -- which is a dead end at exactly the moment someone needs to change
 * something. Edit it, and keep it agreeing with the catalog:
 * scripts/check-db1-client-contract.py matches every call site here against the
 * catalog by arity and reply width, and runs in lint on every pull request.
 * That check is what replaced the generator.
 *
 * Same functions, same contract, different side of the boundary: the daemon
 * links this instead of the DB1 domain, so nothing that calls these had to
 * change.
 *
 * It lives OUTSIDE modules/db1 deliberately. The module's descriptor owns every
 * .c beside it and compiles them into the DB1 process, so a client with these
 * names in that directory would be linked twice into the one binary that must
 * not have it -- once as the caller and once as the implementation.
 *
 * clang-format is off for the body below: its canonical form is whatever this
 * generator emits, and reflowing generated output would put the file and the
 * catalog permanently one reformat apart. */
