# memory module

Memory is one Go module deployed in two placements. `AIMEE_MODULE_PLACEMENT` is
required for a running process:

- `server` owns the appliance user's private `user_memories` rows.
- `kb` owns `global`, `workspace`, and `project` rows in `memories`.

The placement is validated before every data operation. The server's C bus
adapter also replaces any supplied scope with `user`, so a client cannot use the
server placement to address KB memory. The KB placement rejects user scope.

## Runtime contract

The supervised `aimee-module-memory` process is pure Go. It owns extraction,
write gating, embedding, retrieval safety, reranking, command declaration, and
the scoped memory data API.

| Stage | Event | Responsibility |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `extract_index` | 5889 | pattern extraction and retraction scan |
| `write` | 5890 | typed-fact write gate |
| `embedding` | 5891 | governed HTTP embedding and breaker state |
| `retrieve` | 5892 | sensitive-data recall decisions |
| `reranking` | 5893 | confidence-band decision |
| `command-declaration` | 5894 | canonical command inventory |
| `memory-data` | 5895 | scoped CRUD/search, typed-fact extraction and recall, temporal checks, feedback, and maintenance |

The data stage reaches PostgreSQL over the module bus with the storage-only
principal 73. It owns neither a DSN nor a database connection. Both placements
therefore deploy the same executable and storage implementation while retaining
different scope and table boundaries.

## C boundary

C is restricted to transport and host integration:

- `memory_data_bus.c`, `memory_domain_bus.c`, `memory_domain_runtime_bus.c`, `memory_embed_bus.c`,
  `memory_extract_patterns.c`, `memory_content_gate_bus.c`,
  `memory_fact_gate.c`, and `memory_pii_gate.c` encode/decode bounded event-bus
  messages. `memory_scope_connection.c` only binds caller scope to an already
  prepared connection request.
- `gw_stage_memory.c` connects the gateway IR stage to the module.
- `server_hooks.c` connects retired local memory-file writes to the Go policy over
  memory stage 7; classification and shell-write detection live in `redirect.go`.
- `fact_recall.c` preserves the old DB2 ABI but is now only a stage-7 JSON
  adapter. Typed-fact SQL, entity matching, ordering, formatting, and PII
  decisions live in `fact_recall.go`.
- `kb_memory_facts.c` connects the KB drain to its existing curator provider and
  transactional fact-commit connection. Job leasing/reclaim, retry policy,
  exponential jittered backoff, prompt construction, deterministic extraction, model-output parsing,
  grounding, relation canonicalization, kind selection, and provenance are in
  `memory_facts.go`.

`scripts/check_memory_c_boundary.py` freezes that boundary: only the nine named
bus/integration translation units may exist under the memory module, none may
include a DB client, and DB2 may not regain a `memory_*.c` implementation.
The same check prevents the former POSIX/Windows regex-policy files and the
retired in-process C query rewriter from returning; those gates now use
`content_gate.go` through the bus adapter.

There is no C memory engine and no C DB2 `memory_*.c` implementation. A legacy
operation must be added to the Go data handler before its adapter may report
success; a local fallback is forbidden.

## Data operations

The maintained JSON surface supports `get`, `search`, `visible-search`,
`recall`, `briefing`, `list`, `store`, `supersede`, `delete`, `feedback`,
`maintenance`, `upsert-workflow`, `prospective-count`, `fact-recall`,
`valid-at`, `recall-gate`, and `pii-inject`.
The same surface owns the `memory-facts-claim`, `memory-facts-parse`, and
`memory-facts-finish` worker phases used by the KB curator connection adapter.
Host integration also uses `redirect-classify`, `redirect-bash`, and
`content-gate`; those operations are policy in Go and do not touch the store.

KB visible search applies local-first scope ordering: project, workspace, then
global, with ID de-duplication and a single bounded result limit. Server calls
are always user-scoped. Writes use active-row replacement semantics and never
reactivate a retired KB row accidentally.

### Personal recall

The `recall-bundle` operation runs in either placement. Server placement reads
its own user store through the same Go retrieval implementation; it needs no
shared schema or KB-generated envelope. Expired and retired personal records
are excluded. API, CLI, and MCP recall default to that local store; an explicit
`store=kb` selects shared recall without merging personal records. Recall items
include `text`, `memory_id`, and a scoped handle for prompt consumers.

This establishes local record recall, not a complete KB-free model deployment.
Personal vector persistence and synthesis provisioning still need integration.
Structured reminders and directives currently require the shared schema.

## Failure behavior

Required policy stages do not silently run a second implementation. Extraction
returns an error, write gating defers, and PII injection fails closed when the
Go module is unavailable. The cheap recall gate fails open because omitting that
optimization must not suppress a valid recall. Every linker-live legacy ABI
operation now crosses the Go data stage; there is no unavailable shim.

## Verification

The Go package tests cover placement isolation, scope expansion, CRUD,
maintenance, workflow identity, recall gating, extraction, ontology, embedding,
typed-fact planning/grounding, and PII behavior. C tests cover only message
framing and host/connection integration.
Descriptor validation enforces the source inventory, and both `aimee-server`
and `aimee-kb` must link without any retired C memory implementation.
