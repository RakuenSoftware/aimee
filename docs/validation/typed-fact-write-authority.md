# Validating the typed-fact write-authority fixes on a clean container

Two authority gaps in the typed-fact layer were fixed on `worktree-fact-authority-gaps`.
Both are about the same thing: a write that says it speaks for the user, without
anything having checked whether it does. This is the record of running the fixed
build against a real deployment rather than the test shim.

## What was used

- **Host**: Proxmox `pvetest` at 192.168.1.252, `pve-manager/9.2.6`.
- **Container**: LXC **CT 9078** `aimee-fact-authority`, created for this, Debian 13
  standard template, 4 cores / 6GB / 24GB disk, unprivileged, DHCP (192.168.0.194).
- **Build**: `worktree-fact-authority-gaps` off `testing` at `8c7c0b540a`
  (`pre-merge-safety-2700-g8c7c0b540a`, printed by every binary), built locally and
  carried in. Nothing was compiled in the container.
- **Installed**: `aimee`, `aimee-server`, `aimee-kb` into `/usr/local/bin`; PostgreSQL
  17.11 with pgvector from Debian packages.
- **Topology**: the default local one — `aimee-server` reaching `aimee-kb` over plain
  loopback HTTP, which is what `install.sh` and `scripts/aimee-local-stack-e2e.sh
  --mode full` produce.

Scripts are in `scripts/validation/fact-authority/`.

## The two gaps

**Gap 1 — declared authority.** The retraction path took `authority` from the request
body. `{"authority":"user"}` bought the right to delete a user-stated Class-A fact and
to override an `immutable` relation. Worse, `db2_typed_fact_ingress` — reached by the
`get_context_block` MCP tool, whose `query` the *model* composes — passed a hardcoded
`FACT_AUTHORITY_USER`, so an agent could retract the user's facts by writing "forget my
email" into a query nobody asked for.

**Gap 2 — outranked supersede.** On a FUNCTIONAL (single-valued) relation, a new object
contradicts the old one, so the commit path applies the relation's
`correction_behavior`. It did that without checking who was writing, so an ordinary
Class-B model write silently superseded the user's Class-A fact. No retraction endpoint
involved — just a normal write.

## What was checked, and what it found

### Gap 2 on the real engine — the guard is SQL, so the shim proves nothing

The guard is a CASE-rank comparison inside the UPDATE and its probe. `make unit-tests`
runs against the sqlite shim, which *translates* DB2's SQL rather than executing it as
Postgres would, so a guard that is correct under the shim and wrong under libpq stays
green to deployment. The repo has a mode for exactly this (`AIMEE_TEST_PG=1` +
`db2-test-template`); it had not been run for these tests.

Both typed-fact suites pass against real PostgreSQL 17.11:

    unit-test-fact-lifecycle     PASS
    unit-test-fact-ingest        PASS

**Negative control.** Reverting the guard, rebuilding against libpq and re-running gives

    test_fact_lifecycle.c:262: main: Assertion `strcmp(cur, "acme") == 0' failed.

— the model's `globex` had replaced the user's `acme`. So the assertions genuinely run
in postgres mode (they are not silently skipped, as some shim tests are), and they fail
exactly when the guard is absent. Restoring it makes them pass again.

The suite asserts the surviving **target**, not a row count, so "the user's value
stands" cannot be confused with "both values are current" — which is the other way this
could have been wrong, since an outranked write must be *dropped* rather than inserted
alongside.

### Gap 1 through the real stack

Every probe pairs the Class-A escalation attempt with a Class-B control, so a refusal
can be told apart from a broken route or an unreachable service:

| caller | transport | Class A (user-stated) | Class B (model) |
|---|---|---|---|
| agent's bearer | TCP → server | refused at the capability layer | refused (same) |
| person at terminal | UDS → server | `retracted: 1` | `retracted: 1` |
| owner bearer | loopback → kb | `retracted: 1` | `retracted: 1` |
| owner bearer | **remote** → kb | **`retracted: 0`, fact stands** | `retracted: 1` |

The last row is the fix: the same credential, the same request body asking for `user`,
refused because the peer is not local. The Class-B control succeeding in that same run
is what makes the 0 meaningful.

The TCP row is a pre-existing defence (write-tier grants), not this change — worth
recording because it means an agent on the network never reaches the retraction path at
all; the fix matters for the paths that *do* get through.
### `get_context_block` no longer speaks as the user

With `aimee-module-memory` placed in kb (below) the retraction scan actually
fires, so this scenario is finally conclusive. The agent's own query carries the
retraction cue, and both classes go through the identical query:

    user-stated (Class A) before: A current
    after the agent's query:      A current      <- the user's fact stands

    model-authored (Class B) before: B current
    after the same query:            B gone      <- the path is demonstrably live

The Class-B row being retracted is what makes the Class-A row surviving mean
anything. On the first pass, before the module was placed, BOTH survived and the
result proved nothing at all.

### Provenance is stamped from identity, and fails closed

Gap 2's prerequisite: `memories.provenance_category` is what the drain reads later to
decide whether facts mined from a note may be Class A. It defaulted to `user_stated` for
every row, so anything the model chose to remember became a source of permanent facts
outranking the user's own.

    loopback + owner bearer, asking "user":   user_stated
    loopback, asking nothing:                 agent_message
    REMOTE peer, asking "user":               agent_message
    no provenance supplied at all:            agent_message

The last line is the column default, now `agent_message`. The `SET DEFAULT` migration
applies to future inserts only; existing rows keep what they were stored with, which is
the right behaviour for an upgrade — pre-existing Class-A facts are exactly what gap 2's
guard is there to protect.

### memory.delete destroys only for an attested person

A third instance of the same shape, found while sweeping for the pattern:
`memory_delete_command` hardcoded `MEMORY_AUTHORITY_USER`, so any caller clearing
`CAP_MEMORY_ADMIN` hard-destroyed the row and its provenance. The capability is
the right answer to "may this caller delete" and the wrong one to "is this caller
the user" — it sits inside `CAPS_AUTHENTICATED`, so a bearer clears it, and the
destroy is irreversible with an audit event carrying only the id.

The authority now comes from the connection's attestation, the same rule
`facts.retract` and `memory.store` use. A caller that clears the capability but
is not attested as a person still deletes — it retires the row, which
`memory.fact_history` can still read — so this narrows the blast radius, not the
feature. The response reports which happened as `destroyed`.

    UDS, kernel-attested uid:  {"deleted":true,"destroyed":true}   row gone
    TCP bearer, no grant:      refused at the write-tier gate      row untouched

**The TCP line is not evidence of a retire.** Over TCP the request is refused
several layers above the authority decision, by the per-user write-tier grant
gate, and reaching that decision needs a KB-signed identity token this container
has no tenancy to issue. So on a default deployment this change is defence in
depth; it becomes load-bearing the moment an operator issues a grant. The retire
path itself is covered by `test_mcp_memory_gate.c`, which asserts the mapping for
all six `attested_transport_t` values — including `ATTEST_NONE`, the value a
missed hop collapses to — with a negative control confirming the test fails when
the mapping is broken.

### Gap 2 through the REAL commit path, and the placement fix that unblocked it

`aimee-module-memory` is a required module serving 5889-5894, but its
`placements` were `["server"]` while the caller
(`src/kb/kb_module_stage_adapters.c`) runs in kb. aimee-kb called three stages
nothing served there -- `EXTRACT_INDEX` (extraction + retraction scan), `WRITE`
(the typed-fact write gate) and `EMBED` -- each failing as TRANSPORT, so all of
them silently did nothing. `memory` is now placed in `["server", "kb"]`.

The module is stateless: its stages are pure decisions plus one outbound HTTP
call, and "storage, graph, and lifecycle units likewise remain C". So there is no
sqlite-on-server / postgres-on-kb split to reconcile -- the generated kb grant is
byte-identical to the server one and requests nothing. Verified on the container
rather than on paper: built from `server-go/cmd/aimee-module`, installed with its
generated grant, attached to kb's bus, after which the scan stopped answering
"no answer" and the drain ran for the first time.

That made the only production route to the commit gate reachable:
`memory.store` -> `memory_facts` job -> drain -> pattern extractor -> the module's
write gate -> `db2_fact_commit`. Choosing the relation for this took three
attempts, each of which produced a green-looking result that proved nothing:

- `city` is not FUNCTIONAL, so two values legitimately accumulate and no
  correction ever applies;
- `has_hostname` is functional, but the extractor turns "my X is Y" into rel_type
  X verbatim, so that text yields `hostname` -- a different, novel relation, which
  §5 forces to Class C whatever the authority;
- `age` is functional, seed, and extractable -- but produced NO row, because it
  declares tail `NODE_SCALAR` while the extractor classifies a bare number as
  `NODE_OTHER`, so the gate rejected it before the guard was ever consulted.

That last one is a real defect, not just an awkward test: the pattern path had no
kind fixup, so it silently dropped every seed relation whose declared kinds
disagreed with a guess made from the value's spelling. The LLM path in
`kb_memory_facts.c` already repairs exactly this and carries a comment saying why;
only the pattern path was left without it. Fixed in `db2_fact_ingest_text`, with a
unit test that fails without it.

With `age` finally reachable, gap 2 on the real path:

    the user stated:  user/age = 30   class=A  [current]
    a model note says "my age is 41"  (provenance = agent_message)
    after the drain:  30  class=A  [current]        <- alone

    positive control (no prior fact):  ctl@example.com  class=B   <- drain ran
    user-provenance note "my age is 52":  52  class=A  [current]

The control is what makes this evidence: it commits through the same gate on the
same drain, so "41 is absent" is the guard dropping an outranked write rather
than nothing having happened. The last line closes the provenance loop in the
READ direction -- the drain took USER authority from the row's recorded
provenance, not from the hardcoded constant it used before.

## What this did not cover

- **The mTLS/distributed topology.** The asserted-caller path
  (`X-Aimee-Caller-Subject` -> `KB_PRIN_HOST` actor) is wired and unit-tested, but
  this run used the plain-loopback deployment, so the host-actor branch of
  `kb_memory_request_authority()` was not exercised against a live mTLS listener.

- **`memory.delete`'s retire path.** Over TCP the request is refused above the
  authority decision by the per-user write-tier grant gate, and reaching it needs
  a KB-signed identity token this container has no tenancy to issue. The mapping
  is covered for all six attestation values in `test_mcp_memory_gate.c`.

- **The LLM half of the drain.** The synthesis endpoint here is a stub that
  returns an empty fact list, present only because the `memory_facts` drain runs
  on the curator's LLM lane and that lane will not start without a configured
  endpoint. The deterministic pattern pass -- the path under test -- runs before
  the LLM call, so the stub's own responses never influenced a result; jobs that
  end `failed` failed on the LLM call after their facts were already committed.

- **The module's other three stages.** `RETRIEVE`, `RERANK` and
  `DECLARE_COMMANDS` are served by the module but not called by kb, so placing it
  there exercised only the three stages kb uses.
